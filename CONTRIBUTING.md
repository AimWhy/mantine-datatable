# Contributing

If find a bug or you have an idea about a new or missing feature, please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/icflorescu/mantine-datatable/issues).  

If you have an idea about a new or missing feature, let's discuss it here.  
Or better yet, if you're willing to put your effort into it, coming up with a pull-request would be fantastic.  
So many people *take open-source for granted*, but far fewer understand its true essence and are generous enough to contribute their own time and skills to a project they find useful.  
If you're here though, you're probably one of the fewer ones.

**NOTE:** New features are developed in the `next` branch, to make sure to target your PRs accordingly.

Thank you!
