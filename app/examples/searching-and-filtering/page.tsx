        Adjust the array of <Code>records</Code> you’re feeding to {PRODUCT_NAME} based on your own logic in order to
        perform searching and filtering.
        <br />
        In order to support column-based filtering you can use the <Code>filter</Code> and <Code>filtering</Code>{' '}
        <InternalLink to="/examples/column-properties-and-styling">column properties</InternalLink>.
        <br />
        Here’s a possible (rather naive and rough around the edges) implementation:
      </Txt>
      <SearchingAndFilteringExample />
      <Txt>The code for this example is as follows:</Txt>
      <CodeBlock code={code} />
      <Txt info title="Why no built-in “Excel-like” searching and filtering support?">
        You’ll often have to implement searching and filtering data in your projects.
        <br />
        However there’s simply no way for {PRODUCT_NAME} to accommodate every possible usage scenario out there. Most of
        the times you’d have to deal with pagination, sorting, asynchronous loading; sometimes you’d have to place a
        search box or custom filtering criteria selectors in the header of your entire website/application.
        <br />
        Not to mention that in real-life you’d most often do the actual filtering and/or searching in a server API.
        <br />
        The responsibilities and areas of control are most of the times spread across your application’s UI and
        architectural layers, and trying to fit all this in a standard component design and behavior would needlessly
        constrain the developer.
